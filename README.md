These files are a portion of a sprite editor created in a team of 6 for Software Practice II. I was the main contributer for the "spritetools" files, helped with the "mainwindow" files, 
and also created the "shiftPixels" and "fillPixels" methods inside the "Canvas" files.

This project was written in C++ using Qt Creator on Linux Ubuntu.
